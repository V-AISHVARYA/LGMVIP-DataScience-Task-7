# LGMVIP-DataScience-Task-7  
This project focuses on developing a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset.  

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, along with their corresponding labels. The objective is to build a model that can correctly classify these digits based on the pixel values of the images.

In this project, we will be utilizing Tensorflow, a popular deep learning framework, to construct a CNN-based neural network. CNNs are particularly suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture local patterns and hierarchies within images.

## Dataset:  
The MNIST dataset can be accessed directly through Tensorflow's built-in datasets module. Alternatively, you can find the dataset on the MNIST website if needed.  

## Model Architecture:  
Define the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network. You can start with a simple architecture and gradually experiment with more complex ones.

## Training:  
Implement the training loop using the dataset. Train your model using the training images and labels. Monitor the training progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

## Evaluation:   
Evaluate the trained model's performance using the test dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.

## User-Friendly Interface:  
Develop a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to draw or upload handwritten digits. Preprocess the input and use the trained model to predict the digit. Display the prediction along with the confidence score.

## Documentation:   
Provide clear documentation explaining the code, model architecture, and how to use the user interface.
